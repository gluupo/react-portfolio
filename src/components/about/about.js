        <p className="fs-5"><strong>Hi there!</strong>ヾ(≧ ▽ ≦)ゝ I'm Arianna, a recent graduate from UNCC's full-stack coding bootcamp course. I am looking to use my extensive skill-set in social media, project management, and marketing presence to build expressive, responsive and aesthetically appealing experiences in your browser. You can catch me constantly collaborating with a team of friends on various home-lab projects to further my skill-set, pursuing a lifelong passion for technology. I'm continuously developing expertise in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, responsive frameworks, MERN and JAMstack. React is currently my favorite framework. With everything I design, my aim is to strike perfection in both functionality and style. I’m extremely excited to grow in a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build the user experiences of tomorrow. I like to find the most efficient way to go about things. Some things you could find me doing on a daily basis are coding, playing videogames, making art // music, cooking, watching science edutainment, watching anime ((one piece is my favorite, if you like it we can be best friends)) and interior decoration. I have two cats named Luna and Wormie.
