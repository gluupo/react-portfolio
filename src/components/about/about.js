          developer currently in a
          coding bootcamp~ prior to this i was studying colt steele's bootcamp with a friend. i like to find the
          most efficient way to go about things. some things you could find me doing on a daily basis are coding,
          playing
          videogames, making art // music, cooking, watching science edutainment, watching anime ((one piece is my
          favorite, if you like it we can be best friends)) and interior decoraction. i have two cats named luna
          and wormie, luna is white and wormie is grey. i am honestly just trying to fill text at this point. i
          really like memes. one i'm currently into is john cena somehow speaking fluent mandarin and saying what
          sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w_0XAqI830" target="_blank">"BING CHILLING"</a>.
          quality content. <a href="https://youtu.be/Frf6BeRX9AU" target="_blank">this</a> and <a
            href="https://youtu.be/8C4lK41SX-Q" target="_blank">this</a> are classics though.
