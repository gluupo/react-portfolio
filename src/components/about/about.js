        <p><strong>hi there!</strong> i'm arianna, a recent graduate from uncc's full stack coding bootcamp course. i am looking to use my extensive skill-set in marketing and social media presence to build expressive, responsive and aesthetically appealing experiences in your browser. constantly collaborating with a team of friends on various home-lab projects to further my skill-set, pursuing a lifelong passion for technology. continuously developing expertise in JavaScript, CSS, Node, responsive frameworks, and MERN stack. with everything i design, my aim is to strike perfection in both functionality and style. iâ€™m extremely excited to grow in a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build the user experiences of tomorrow. i like to find the most efficient way to go about things. some things you could find me doing on a daily basis are coding, playing videogames, making art // music, cooking, watching science edutainment, watching anime ((one piece is my favorite, if you like it we can be best friends)) and interior decoration. i have two cats named luna and wormie, luna is white and wormie is grey.
